[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[close auto backup]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]

By default, emacs will make a copy of the old version of your file
when you modify it. Thus it will generate lots of *~ in your
directory.  At the worst case, your file will occupy twice large room
in your disk.

Although the backup function may be useful sometime, I think most
people would like to close it for a clean directory.

(setq make-backup-files nil)

Automatically open hs-minor-mode when in c/c++ mode:

(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'hs-minor-mode)

[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[ parenthesis ]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]

To auto complete parenthesis, curly braces, bracket, use

(electric-pair-mode t)

To highlight the matching parenthesis, curly braces, brackets, use

(show-paren-mode 1)

The following function will show you the content of the line which
matching parenthesis belong to. However, after this function works,
emacs will report an error. I don't know elisp, so I can't figure out
what is going wrong here. If some one know the reason, tell me.

(defadvice show-paren-function
    (after show-matching-paren-offscreen activate)
  (interactive)
  (let* ((cb (char-before (point)))
	 (matching-text (and cb
			     (char-equal (char-syntax cb) ?\) )
			     (blink-matching-open))))
    (when matching-text (message matching-text))))

[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[ using melpa on windows ]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]

Emacs will counter network error on windows when you want to install
some packages from Melpa or GNU.  To resolve this problem, download an
available verson of gnutls and a w64 version of emacs. Then put the
bin directory of both together.  Then the emacs command
"package-list-packages" should work.
