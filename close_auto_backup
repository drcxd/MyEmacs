By default, emacs will make a copy of the old version of your file when you modify it. Thus it will generate lots of *~ in your directory.
At the worst case, your file will occupy twice large room in your disk.

Althou the backup function may be useful sometime, I think most people would like to close it for a clean directory.
Add

(setq make-backup-files nil)

in your .emacs or init file to close the auto backup functionality.
