To auto complete parenthesis, curly braces, bracket, use

M-x electric-pair-mode

or add 

(electric-pair-mode t)

in your .emacs or other init file.


To highlight the matching parenthesis, curly braces, brackets, use

M-x show-paren-mode

or add

(show-paren-mode 1)

in your .emacso r other init file.

See more information:

The following function will show you the content of the line which matching parenthesis belong to. However, after this function works,
emacs will report an error. I don't know elisp, so I can't figure out what is going wrong here. If some one know the reason, tell me.

(defadvice show-paren-function
    (after show-matching-paren-offscreen activate)
  (interactive)
  (let* ((cb (char-before (point)))
	 (matching-text (and cb
			     (char-equal (char-syntax cb) ?\) )
			     (blink-matching-open))))
    (when matching-text (message matching-text))))
