# Personal Emacs Configuration

This repository is the emacs configuration I personally used and
developed.

The structure of the configuration and part of the elisp code is
mainly learned from [Bin Chen's configuration](https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d)

# Melpa and Auto Downloading Packages

This configuration will auto download what is need from the melpa. I
find this is a convenient feature which makes the user could use this
configuration right away instead of have to handling all the
installation of each packae.

# Company

Company may be the most popular completion front end in the emacs
community now. 

# Helm

Help programmers find what they need quickly.

# Linum-mode

Modify the default setting of linum-mode in emacs. There will be an
extra space between the line number and the content of the
file. Linum-mode may not be activated in every buffer depends on
buffer type and the lenght of it.

# Misc

Everything else here.

# Func

Self defined function in `init-func.el`. Add some subroutine I find
useful.
